# DOLT

See [the dolt homepage for documentation][2].

This was the first piece of software I wrote in Perl, and
(possibly) the second piece of software I wrote that I
considered useful.

It exists in this repository because I hate breaking links
on the WWW.

Don't try to use it, it isn't very good. Anything it can do,
[ttree][1] can do better.
